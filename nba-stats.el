;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Nba-stats is a small script that fetches real time scores or stats
;; for the current NBA Season.
;;
;; This script depends on NBA's internal API's that I have traced through
;; NBA.com's network XHR Requests.  If any formatting in the JSON or URL path
;; changes, then unfortunately this script is of no use and will need to be
;; updated accrodingly.

;;; Installation:

;; 1. Place nba-stats.el on your Emacs load-path.
;;
;; 2. Compile the file (necessary for speed):
;; M-x byte-compile-file <location of nba-stats.el>
;;
;; 3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
;; (require 'nba-stats)
;;
;; - Call the function of choice:
;; M-x nba-scores
;; M-x nba-player-stats

;;; TODO: Query for individual player/team season stats

;;; Code:

;;; Customize interface:

;; (require 'request)
;; (require 'json)
